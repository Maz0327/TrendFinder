Got it — I’ll take the **Jimmy John’s PAC Drop** you uploaded and reframe it into our **DSD Signal Drop** structure so you can see how it would work inside our automated brief builder.

## **Jimmy John’s – DSD Signal Drop**

*(Define → Shift → Deliver)*

---

### **DEFINE** – *Who & Where We’re Playing*

**Life Lens**

* Busy, convenience-driven consumers seeking quick, reliable meals without sacrificing quality.
* Mix of loyal fans and casual lunch-goers; humor resonates more than traditional “food porn” visuals.

**Raw Behavior**

* Social engagement peaks in late mornings and early lunch hours.
* Heavy participation in “quirky brand voice” moments — memes, playful banter, and self-aware humor.

**Channel Vibes**

* Twitter/X: Banter-heavy, snark works well.
* TikTok: Lo-fi, personality-first content from behind the counter or “inside the brand.”
* Instagram: Still image humor performs better than polished food shots in this category.

---

### **SHIFT** – *The Change We Want to See*

**Strategic Intelligence**

* The fast-sandwich market is noisy; humor is Jimmy John’s biggest differentiator.
* Competitors lean into either food shots or heavy promos — few balance humor *and* brand message effectively.

**Human Truth**

* People want lunch to be fun, not a chore. They crave brands that make them smile during the mid-day slump.

**Cultural Moment**

* Meme culture has bled into mainstream advertising — consumers expect brands to have a personality, not just a product.

---

### **DELIVER** – *How We Make It Happen*

**Creative Territories**

1. **“Freaky Fast, Freaky Fun”** – Highlighting speed while delivering personality-driven humor.
2. **Meme Your Meal** – Inviting fans to create their own Jimmy John’s meme templates.
3. **Behind the Bread** – Playful, lo-fi BTS of sandwich-making moments.

**Execution Ideas**

* TikTok trend hijacks with JJ’s tone layered in.
* Meme template series seeded on X and IG Stories.
* “Lunch Hour Takeovers” — personality-driven, 1-hour real-time social stunts.

**Attention Value & Viral Potential**

* **Attention Value:** High — the blend of humor + lunch relevance is a strong scroll-stopper.
* **Viral Potential:** Medium-High — if seeded with timely cultural hooks.

### **Automation Notes** *(for our system)*

Here’s how the system could map captured content & tags to this brief:

| **Tag**                | **Where It Lands**             | **Example**                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Life Lens              | Define → Life Lens             | Screenshot of target audience comment, note from strategist |
| Raw Behavior           | Define → Raw Behavior          | Engagement charts, user patterns from truth analysis        |
| Channel Vibes          | Define → Channel Vibes         | Platform-specific examples from captured posts              |
| Strategic Intelligence | Shift → Strategic Intelligence | AI synthesis from multiple signals                          |
| Human Truth            | Shift → Human Truth            | Insights from truth analysis with emotional drivers         |
| Cultural Moment        | Shift → Cultural Moment        | Screenshots of trending memes relevant to the brand         |
| Creative Territories   | Deliver → Creative Territories | AI-suggested based on patterns in captures                  |
| Execution Ideas        | Deliver → Execution Ideas      | User or AI-proposed concepts from pattern recognition       |
| Attention Value        | Deliver → Attention Value      | AI-calculated from engagement ratios                        |
| Viral Potential        | Deliver → Viral Potential      | AI forecast from historical pattern matches                 |

This structure would mean:

* The **Chrome extension tags** → directly fill the **DSD Signal Drop** sections.
* **Truth Analysis** → gives the “why” behind each signal (Fact → Observation → Insight → Human Truth → Cultural Moment).
* **Brief export** → clean Google Slides in the DSD format, ready for final tweaks.

If you want, I can now **mock up a sample Google Slides export layout** for this Jimmy John’s brief so you can see exactly how it would look post-automation. That will help lock both the workflow and the UI tagging logic.

Do you want me to make that mockup next?
