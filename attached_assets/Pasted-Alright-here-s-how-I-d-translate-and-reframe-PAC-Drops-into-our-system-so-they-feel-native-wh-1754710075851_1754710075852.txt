Alright — here’s how I’d **translate and reframe PAC Drops** into our system so they feel native, while keeping the spirit of the original Vayner process.

## **Our System’s PAC Equivalent: "DSD Signal Drop"**

*(Define → Shift → Deliver)*

### **1. Define** *(PAC → Audience & Platform)*

* **Life Lens** – Who we’re speaking to: audience mindset, life stage, and shared values.
* **Raw Behavior** – Verified behavioral patterns from platform data, purchase actions, or real-world cues.
* **Channel Vibes** – Platform-specific behaviors, language, content norms, and algorithm quirks.

📌 **Purpose:** Gives the strategist an exact read on *who* and *where* the conversation is happening before creative work starts.

---

### **2. Shift** *(PAC → Insight & Context)*

* **Strategic Intelligence** – Distilled patterns from observations + truths in captured content.
* **Human Truth** – The deep emotional or motivational driver behind the audience’s actions.
* **Cultural Moment** – The wider cultural or market context influencing timing and relevance.

📌 **Purpose:** Clearly states the *change we want to create* in perception, behavior, or conversation.

---

### **3. Deliver** *(PAC → Creative)*

* **Creative Territories** – Potential themes, narratives, or content hooks that align with the audience and platform.
* **Execution Ideas** – Suggested content formats, creative angles, or activations.
* **Attention Value & Viral Potential** – Prioritized opportunities for maximum impact.

📌 **Purpose:** Provides the *how* — the creative roadmap that makes the shift happen in-market.

### **Why This Works for Our System**

* **Keeps PAC’s strategic clarity** but nests it inside our Define → Shift → Deliver framework so it works with truth analysis and tags.
* **Directly maps to the tags** we’re giving users in the Chrome extension, so captured content flows into the right section automatically.
* **Allows PAC Drops to be automated** by batching captures → truth analysis → organized brief export in Google Slides without the user having to manually rearrange everything.

---

If we implement this, I’d also suggest **renaming “PAC Drop” in our UI** to something like:

* *Signal Drop*
* *Strategist Drop*
* *DSD Brief*

So it feels proprietary to your system and not borrowed from Vayner.

If you want, I can now **take one of the "Jimmy John’s PAC Drop" decks** you gave me and rewrite it in this *DSD Signal Drop* format so you can see exactly how the automation would fill it in. That way we can lock the workflow before building.
