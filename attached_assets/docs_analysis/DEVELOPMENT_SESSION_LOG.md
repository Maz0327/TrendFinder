- **Current State**: Complete system with React frontend, Express backend, Chrome extension, and PostgreSQL database
- **Key Achievement**: Successfully migrated entire project to GitHub for version control and memory management

### Development Session Summary

#### Initial Challenge - Git Repository Setup
**User Request**: "Build a strategic content analysis platform that captures content from multiple sources, analyzes it using AI for deep behavioral insights and cultural truths"

**Technical Challenge**: 
- System git restrictions preventing automated repository operations
- Need to preserve complete project with all documentation for future sessions
- Memory management strategy required for long-term development

#### Solution Approach
1. **Manual GitHub Repository Creation**
   - Repository: https://github.com/Maz0327/Strategist-App
   - Complete codebase migration including Chrome extension
   - All documentation preserved including replit.md

2. **Git Workflow Established**
   - System restrictions require manual git operations
   - Development continues normally in Replit
   - Manual push required for updates: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main`

#### Technical Issues Resolved
- **Large File Error**: 161MB tar.gz file exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit
- **Solution**: Updated .gitignore to exclude large archive files
- **Git Lock Files**: Resolved repository lock conflicts
- **Remote URL Issues**: Fixed GitHub remote configuration

#### Key User Feedback & Decisions
- **User Preference**: "Simple, everyday language" - documented in User Preferences
- **Memory Management**: "How can we save memory space in this chat now that the project is moved to git?"
- **Development Workflow**: Confirmed preference for normal development with manual git operations
- **Future Sessions**: Requested conversation preservation for continuity

#### Current Project Status

- **Efficiency**: Values concise, actionable responses without repetitive phrases
- **Problem-Solving**: Direct approach with clear explanations of what's being done
- **Documentation**: Emphasizes comprehensive documentation for memory management between sessions
- **Independence**: Prefers editor to work autonomously with periodic check-ins
- **Task Completion**: Expects complete solutions rather than partial implementations
- **Error Handling**: Wants issues resolved before proceeding with other changes
- **Parallel Processing**: Appreciates multiple tools being used simultaneously for efficiency

### Development Philosophy & Approach
- **"Build better, not build more"** - User prioritizes system stability and optimization over adding new features
- **Incremental Development** - Focus on completing one area thoroughly before moving to next
- **Production Readiness** - Emphasis on clean, optimized code without development artifacts
- **Memory Management Awareness** - User concerned about sustainable development approach to avoid AI memory constraints
- **Truth-Based Analysis** - Implemented framework providing deeper strategic insights beyond surface-level sentiment
- **Cultural Intelligence** - Added to identify attention arbitrage opportunities and cultural moments
- **User-Driven Workflow** - Users control what becomes strategically valuable through manual flagging

### Key Technical Decisions & Rationale
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL with Supabase for scalability and real-time features
