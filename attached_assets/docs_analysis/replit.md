### Critical UX Issues Identified - July 21, 2025 (End of Day)

**User Feedback Session**: User identified 5 critical bugs requiring immediate attention before any new feature development:

1. **Loading State Inconsistency (HIGH PRIORITY)**:
   - Issue: Loading bars across tabs don't match Truth Analysis design, color, or functionality
   - Impact: Unprofessional user experience, inconsistent visual language
   - User Quote: "NONE of the loading bars in any tab matches the 'truth analysis' loading bar why?"
   - Solution Required: Standardize ALL loading states to match Truth Analysis exactly

2. **Today's Briefing Structure (HIGH PRIORITY)**:
   - Issue: Shows "recent signals" instead of required 4-section layout
   - Required Structure:
     * Client Channels feed summary + highlights + top 3 items + "view all" button
     * Custom feeds summary + highlights + top 3 articles + "view all" button  
     * Project Intelligence summary + highlights + top 3 items + "view all" button
     * Three most recent analyzed signals + "view all" button
   - Impact: Core homepage doesn't meet strategic workflow requirements

3. **Broken Feed Navigation (CRITICAL)**:
   - Issue: "Client Channels", "Custom Feeds", "Project Intelligence" buttons non-functional
   - Issue: "Feeds" button incorrectly redirects to Today's Briefing instead of feeds section
   - Impact: Core platform features inaccessible to users
   - User Quote: "Feeds buttons in the side nav dont work"

4. **Explore Signals Default State (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**:
   - Issue: Page loads empty instead of defaulting to Trending Topics
   - Issue: Navigation buttons under Explore Signals are non-functional
   - Impact: Key discovery feature appears broken on first visit

5. **Strategic Brief Lab Navigation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**:
   - Issue: Should default to "Brief Builder" but doesn't
   - Issue: Navigation shows "Cohort Builder" instead of "Brief Builder"
   - Impact: Core strategic workflow starts on wrong section

**User Communication Preferences**:
- **Quality Over Speed**: "dont change anything yet" - wants comprehensive planning before implementation
- **Systematic Approach**: Requests detailed implementation strategy to avoid breaking system
- **Production Standards**: High expectations for polished, professional user experience
- **Risk Awareness**: Concerned about system stability during modifications

**Implementation Strategy Approved by User**:
1. **Phase 1**: Loading state standardization (safest changes first)
2. **Phase 2**: Navigation routing fixes (medium risk)
3. **Phase 3**: Default tab corrections (low complexity)
4. **Phase 4**: Today's Briefing restructure (highest risk, done last)

**Implementation Strategy Approved by User**:
1. **Phase 1**: Loading state standardization (safest changes first) ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Phase 2**: Navigation routing fixes (medium risk) ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Phase 3**: Default tab corrections (low complexity) ✅ COMPLETED
4. **Phase 4**: Today's Briefing restructure (highest risk, done last) - IN PROGRESS
5. **Phase 5**: Real Feed Functionality Implementation - PLANNED

**Next Session Requirements**:
- Complete Phase 4: Today's Briefing 4-section restructure
