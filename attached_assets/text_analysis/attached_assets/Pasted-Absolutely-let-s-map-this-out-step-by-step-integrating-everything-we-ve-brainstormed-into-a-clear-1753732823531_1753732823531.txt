Absolutely — let’s map this out step-by-step, integrating everything we’ve brainstormed into a clear workflow, so you know what to build, how it works, and why it matters.

✅ STRATEGIC WORKFLOW: CAPTURE TO BRIEF (MVP+)

⸻

🧩 MODULES YOU’LL BE BUILDING

Before diving into the steps, here’s what we’re building piece-by-piece:

Module Name	Purpose
Chrome Extension	Capture content (screenshots, links, notes, tags) into system
Capture Workspace	Organize, review, tag, edit captures — the user’s “war room”
Truth Analysis Engine	Batch or inline analysis using GPT-4o, with tag-aware interpretation
Gemini Visual Classifier	Classify screenshots (tweet, video, comment, stat, etc.)
Brief Builder UI	Drag-and-drop or auto-populate content into structured brief
Google Slides Export	One-click export of finalized brief


⸻

🧠 FULL USER WORKFLOW (Step-by-Step)

⸻

1. Start a New Project or Open Existing
	•	User clicks “New Project” (name, optional tags, goal)
	•	System creates a container for all content, brief drafts, and export files
	•	Keeps projects separate and organized

⸻

2. Capture Content via Chrome Extension
	•	User browses the web and clicks the extension to:
	•	Take screenshots (auto-time-stamped, site-detected)
	•	Add optional notes
	•	Select tags (from simplified list: Define, Shift, Deliver, Cultural Moment, Insight, etc.)
	•	Add to: active project (dropdown)
	•	Captures sync to the user’s “Workspace”

🔁 System auto-assigns session_id + metadata (source, time, page)
💡 Optional: Add Gemini visual classifier behind the scenes to tag screenshot type.

⸻

3. User Organizes Captures in the Workspace
	•	All captured content appears in card layout:
	•	Left: screenshot or link preview
	•	Right: user notes, tags, edit button, truth analysis option

🔧 User can:
	•	Add or adjust tags
	•	Edit notes
	•	Star/favorite key captures
	•	Choose whether to run Truth Analysis now or later

🧠 Gemini text extraction runs automatically to pull any on-image copy.

⸻

4. Truth Analysis (Inline or Batch Mode)

Two options:
	1.	Inline: Click “Analyze” on any card → truthAnalysis JSON appears under it
	2.	Batch: Select captures → run analysis on all selected (use depth mode: Quick or Deep)

📥 Notes + extracted text + tags = passed to GPT-4o
📊 Output: fact, observation, insight, humanTruth, culturalMoment, etc.

⸻

5. Draft the Brief (Manual + Auto Mode)

User clicks into the Brief Builder for that project.

👷‍♀️ Builder is divided into sections (based on Define → Shift → Deliver):

Section	Populated By
Define	User-selected captures tagged as Define or containing insights
Shift	Cultural Moments, Strategic tensions, Observations
Deliver	Human Truths, hooks, meme formats, references from captures
Add-ons	Favorites, Stats, Trends, Competitive content

✳️ Users can:
	•	Drag cards from workspace into sections
	•	Let the system auto-suggest placement based on tags + truthAnalysis

⸻

6. Final Review + Google Slides Export

Once brief is complete:
	•	User previews all sections (editable content)
	•	Finalize → click “Export as Google Slides”
	•	System uses Slide template based on brief type (Kickoff, Sprint, Trend, etc.)

Slides auto-fill with:
	•	Title + section headers
	•	Text from analysis
	•	Captures + screenshots in layout
	•	Attribution (source, platform)

⸻

🛠️ Optional (For Future Phase)

Feature	Description
Smart Sorting	Auto-prioritize “high-attention” or high-engagement captures
Custom Brief Templates	Let users upload GSlides file to train structure preferences
AI Summary Card	Gemini generates 1-slide brief summary with TL;DR + visual references
Team Collaboration	Allow team comments, editing, shared workspaces


⸻

✅ NEXT STEPS FOR YOU TO BUILD
	1.	Build the Workspace UI
	•	Cards for each capture with edit, tag, truth analysis, star
	2.	Batch / Inline Truth Analysis
	•	Use your routing + depth model (Speed/Quick/Deep Dive)
	3.	Linking System
	•	Ensure each capture is clearly tied to project → brief → export
	4.	Brief Builder UI
	•	Drag-and-drop cards into brief sections, editable fields
	5.	GSlides Export Logic
	•	Format match + content injection into Slide template
