This setup is already extremely well-structured ‚Äî you're striking the right balance between schema control, tone naturality, and format enforcement.

Here's a breakdown of how to **maximize quality per model** while respecting speed constraints and ensuring consistency in strategic accuracy:

### üîç Breakdown of the 5 Truth Analysis Categories (Clarified for Model Alignment)

| Category            | Goal (for the AI)                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fact**            | What happened, plain and objective (data, events, quotes).                      |
| **Observation**     | Patterns, anomalies, or strategic takeaways based on the fact.                  |
| **Insight**         | The ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù‚Äîimplication that can be acted on.                                |
| **Human Truth**     | The underlying belief, motivation, or psychological driver behind the behavior. |
| **Cultural Moment** | The macro social context or why this matters right now in culture.              |

### üß† Model-Specific Strategy for API Calls

#### ‚úÖ GPT-3.5 Turbo

* **Best Use**: Speed-first use cases. Only good for *Fact* and *Observation*.
* **Weakness**: Struggles with abstraction (Insight, Human Truth, Culture).
* **Recommended Prompt Modifications**:

  * Use only:

    ```json
    {
      "fact": "...",
      "observation": "..."
    }
    ```
  * Use sentenceCount = 1 or 2
  * Use fewer creative verbs, more literal phrasing. Use ‚Äúdescribe‚Äù, ‚Äúexplain‚Äù, not ‚Äúreveal‚Äù or ‚Äúuncover‚Äù

#### ‚ö° GPT-4o-Mini

* **Best Use**: Mid-tier performance. Handles *Insight* with basic accuracy. Fast enough for prototyping or bulk runs.
* **Suggested Prompt Modifications**:

  * Keep full `truthAnalysis` schema
  * Set sentenceCount = 2‚Äì3
  * Use adjusted field guidance like:

    ```json
    "insight": "Describe a meaningful conclusion we can draw from the observation"
    ```
  * Keep all schema-based structure. Add optional `hints` if it begins hallucinating cultural references.

#### üß† GPT-4o

* **Best Use**: Premium accuracy for all 5 categories.
* **Strength**: Handles abstract reasoning + cultural nuance.
* **Recommended Prompt Modifications**:

  * Use sentenceCount = 4‚Äì7 (based on Speed/Deep toggle)
  * Maintain full schema (including competitiveInsights, cohortOpportunities, etc.)
  * Add these subtle role instructions in the **system prompt** for deeper coherence:

    ```
    Your job is to think like a cultural strategist building a client presentation.
    Go beyond surface-level. Tie context to behavior, emotion to trends.
    Emphasize audience psychology and social shifts.
    ```

### üìê Smart Prompt Control Suggestions

* **Add `content_type` metadata** (e.g. tweet, IG caption, headline, blog) ‚Äî different content types yield different signal depth. This helps GPT pick appropriate tone.
* **Platform-specific examples** in prompt if known (`platform: "TikTok"` ‚Üí style changes).
* **Contextual backfill**: If original content is sparse, allow you to include surrounding social post, replies, etc., to give AI more context.

---

### üîÑ Unified Prompt Adaptation System (Optional Layer)

You could build a **Truth Analysis Optimizer Layer**:

1. Detect content complexity or platform.
2. Route content to the appropriate model:

   * Simple = GPT-3.5
   * Moderate = 4o-Mini
   * Complex/Nuanced = 4o
3. Inject custom system prompt rules (speed toggle: Speed / Quick / Deep).

### ‚úÖ Summary Recommendations

| Model         | Use Case                     | sentenceCount | Fields to Include        | Notes                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | Rapid facts, light analysis  | 1‚Äì2           | fact, observation        | Don't use for Human Truth or Cultural Moment                         |
| GPT-4o-Mini   | Balanced speed + nuance      | 2‚Äì4           | All fields               | Great for prototyping and mid-range automation                       |
| GPT-4o        | High-quality strategy output | 4‚Äì7           | All fields + full schema | Best model for anything client-facing or involving cultural strategy |

Let me know if you‚Äôd like:

* API-optimized prompt formats for each model
* Routing pseudocode for dynamic model assignment
* An adjustment schema to tune outputs based on sentence count or depth preference (e.g. "Speed", "Deep Dive", etc.)

This architecture you're building is deeply sound ‚Äî you're designing it like a strategist would.
