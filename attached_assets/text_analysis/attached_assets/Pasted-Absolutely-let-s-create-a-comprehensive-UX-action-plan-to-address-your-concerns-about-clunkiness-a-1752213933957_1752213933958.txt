Absolutely — let’s create a comprehensive UX action plan to address your concerns about clunkiness and chaos in the interface. This will include:
	1.	A detailed UI/UX restructuring plan
	2.	Terminology & naming suggestions for core modules
	3.	Contextual reasoning and product philosophy behind each recommendation

✅ 1. UI/UX STRUCTURAL REDESIGN PLAN

🔧 Module	🎯 Suggested Redesign	📘 Why This Matters
Homepage (Dashboard.tsx)	Rename to: Today’s Briefing or Daily Signal Hub  Show: 3–5 curated top insights from TikTok/Reddit/Trends  CTA buttons: “Capture a New Signal”, “Browse Signals”, “Start a Brief”	Your current dashboard has too many tools upfront. A curated dashboard gives strategists quick orientation and daily relevance — no guesswork required.
Signal Mining Dashboard	Merge with: Trending Topics + System Suggestions  New name: Explore Signals  Filters: Source (TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn), Topic, Sentiment	Strategists don’t think in “modules” — they explore what’s happening across platforms. This creates a single, intuitive discovery experience.
Content Input / Capture	Keep simple. Rename to: New Signal Capture  Flow: Add URL → Tags → AI Summary (shown after save) → Option to “Add to Brief”	This should feel lightweight and fast. Rename aligns with mental model: “I’m capturing something interesting.”
Brief Builder	Rename to: Strategic Brief Lab  Tabs inside: “GET TO BY Framework”, “Add Signals”, “Export”	Give the Brief Builder a workspace feel. By using ‘Lab’, it feels creative and open-ended, not restrictive.
System Suggestions	Show dynamically inside the Brief Lab and Explore Signals  Suggest: Cohorts, Insights, Missing Angles based on usage	Strategists love prompts — but only if timely and contextual. Don’t silo this feature. Make it ambient.
Cohort Builder	Rename to: Audience Insight Generator  Place it behind “Advanced Brief Tools” toggle in Brief Lab	Keeps the main flow clean while still giving access to deeper tools. More natural phrasing for “cohort.”
Reactive Content Builder	Rename to: Realtime Opportunity Feed  House it inside Explore Signals, shown only if user filters by “Real-Time”	Reduce module overload and place it where it contextually belongs: discovery.

🧠 2. TERMINOLOGY CHANGES & RATIONALE

Old Term	Suggested New Term	Why This Works
Signal Mining	Explore Signals	“Mining” sounds technical. “Explore” matches real strategist language.
Capture Tool	New Signal Capture	Descriptive and action-oriented. Feels intuitive to use.
Brief Builder	Strategic Brief Lab	Makes the tool feel less rigid and more like a collaborative ideation space.
Cohort Builder	Audience Insight Generator	“Cohort” is jargony. This feels more human and creative.
Reactive Content Builder	Realtime Opportunity Feed	Describes exactly what the user gets, in their language.
Suggestions	Smart Prompts	“Suggestions” feels ignorable; “Prompts” implies useful starting points.
Dashboard	Today’s Briefing / Daily Hub	More specific, time-sensitive — builds a habit of checking it like a strategist’s newsfeed.

🧩 3. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: MENTAL MODEL ALIGNMENT

Current Issue:

The app feels like a toolkit dumped in front of a user. Everything is there, but they don’t know where to start or what’s important.

Solution:

Create anchoring pages that reflect the strategist’s daily rhythm:

	•	What do I need to know today? → “Today’s Briefing”
	•	What’s happening across platforms? → “Explore Signals”
	•	What am I building? → “Brief Lab”
	•	Who am I speaking to? → “Audience Generator”
	•	Is the system helping me? → Smart Prompts that appear throughout

🗺️ 4. SUGGESTED USER FLOW

[Login] 
   ↓
[Today’s Briefing]
   ↓
[Explore Signals]  → “Add to Brief” →
   ↓                                ↓
[Brief Lab] ← Smart Suggestions ← Content Input
   ↓
[Export Brief]

This creates a natural, progressive journey from discovery to delivery — no more bouncing between siloed modules.

🛠️ 5. NEXT ACTIONS
	1.	Rename modules and file structure to reflect clearer naming
	2.	Update the sidebar navigation to group by:
	•	Discover
	•	Capture
	•	Build
	•	Advanced
	3.	Refactor dashboard into a true “Today’s Briefing” hub
	4.	Merge redundant modules into singular surfaces (Explore Signals)
	5.	Add contextual buttons (e.g. “Add to Brief” after capture or explore)
	6.	Write microcopy for each renamed module that explains the purpose in 1–2 lines
	7.	Add “Quick Tour” feature on first login to guide new users through the flow
