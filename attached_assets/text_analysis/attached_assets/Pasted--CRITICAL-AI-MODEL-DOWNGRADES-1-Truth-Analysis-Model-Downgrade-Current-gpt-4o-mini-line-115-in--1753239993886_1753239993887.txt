üîª CRITICAL AI MODEL DOWNGRADES
1. Truth Analysis Model Downgrade
Current: gpt-4o-mini (line 115 in openai.ts)
July 21 Working: gpt-4o for deep analysis
Impact: 17x cheaper but significantly reduced strategic reasoning quality
2. Visual Analysis Model Inconsistency
Gemini Service: Uses gemini-2.5-pro (correct)
Routes Response: Shows "engine": "gemini-2.0-flash-preview" (outdated reference)
Impact: Confusion about which model is actually being used
‚ö° PERFORMANCE DOWNGRADES
3. Aggressive Timeout Reductions
Scraper Timeout: Reduced from 15s to 5s
Content Extraction: "Ultra-fast 3-second mode"
Video Processing: Reduced from 3 minutes to 10 seconds
Impact: Premature failures on legitimate content that needs more processing time
4. Content Length Restrictions
Character Limit: Imposed 12,000 character limit (was unlimited)
Comment Limits: Max 50 comments (was more flexible)
Comment Length: 500 chars max per comment
Impact: Truncating valuable long-form content and comprehensive analysis
5. Network Request Downgrades
Redirects: Limited to 3 redirects (from standard handling)
Axios Timeout: Reduced to 5 seconds
Image Analysis: Limited to 3 images max
Impact: Failing on legitimate websites with standard redirect patterns
üõ°Ô∏è OVER-DEFENSIVE CODING PATTERNS
6. Excessive Null Checking
Found throughout codebase:

result.keywords || []
result.cohortSuggestions || []
result.competitiveInsights || []
Impact: Masking real errors with empty arrays instead of proper error handling
7. Over-Simplified Error Handling
Automatic fallbacks instead of investigating root causes
Generic error messages hiding specific issues
Impact: Makes debugging nearly impossible
üìä ANALYSIS QUALITY DOWNGRADES
8. Visual Analysis Separation
Current: Visual analysis artificially separated from truth analysis
July 21: Integrated seamlessly in single workflow
Impact: Broken user expectation of unified analysis
9. Temperature Settings
OpenAI Temperature: Set to 0.7 (higher randomness)
Should be: Lower temperature (0.1-0.3) for consistent strategic analysis
Impact: Less predictable analysis quality
10. Max Tokens Reduction
Current: max_tokens: 2000
Should be: Higher limits for comprehensive analysis
Impact: Truncated strategic insights
üîÑ CACHE SYSTEM OVER-COMPLEXITY
11. Complex Redis Fallback
Multiple cache implementations causing race conditions
Over-engineered memory/Redis switching logic
Impact: Inconsistent caching behavior and potential data loss
12. Cache Key Fragmentation
Complex cache key generation with version suffixes
Multiple cache types causing confusion
Impact: Poor cache hit rates, repeated API calls
üåê CONTENT EXTRACTION DOWNGRADES
13. Social Media Extraction Simplified
Instagram URLs now use mock data instead of real extraction
Complex social media extraction disabled
Impact: Poor quality content for strategic analysis
14. Video Transcription Disabled
Video URLs treated as regular web pages
Transcription marked as "temporarily disabled in MVP"
Impact: Missing crucial audio content analysis
üéØ STRATEGIC BRIEF QUALITY DOWNGRADES
15. Brief Generation Model
Not clear if brief generation is using Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently
Potential fallback to lower-quality models
Impact: Reduced strategic brief quality
üîß RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE RESTORATION
Priority 1: AI Models
Restore gpt-4o for truth analysis
Ensure gemini-2.5-pro for visual analysis and brief generation
Fix model references in response metadata
Priority 2: Timeout & Limits
Restore reasonable timeouts (15s scraper, 30s video)
Remove artificial character limits
Allow unlimited content length with chunking
Priority 3: Integration
Re-integrate visual analysis into truth analysis workflow
Restore video transcription capabilities
Fix social media content extraction
Priority 4: System Simplification
Simplify cache system to single implementation
Remove over-defensive null checks
Restore proper error handling with specific messages
This analysis shows the system was systematically "optimized" for speed and cost at the expense of quality - essentially turning an enterprise-grade system into a basic MVP. The July 21 state was the optimal balance of performance and quality.
