Of course. After re-analyzing all three files with a specific focus on finding the source code, here is a definitive breakdown of what code is present in each document.

In short, none of the documents contain the *complete* source code for the entire platform. However, by combining them, you get the full source code for several of the most critical files.

---

### File 1: `COMPLETE_SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md`

This document is a **partial code export** that provides the full source for a few key files.

* **Code It Contains (Complete Files):**
    * `shared/schema.ts`: The complete Drizzle ORM database schema, including all 14 tables, Zod validation schemas, and type exports.
    * `server/services/openai.ts`: The complete source code for the main OpenAI analysis service.
    * `server/routes.ts`: The complete source code for the primary API routes controller.
    * `client/src/App.tsx`: The main frontend React component.
    * `package.json`: The complete list of project dependencies and scripts.
    * `chrome-extension/manifest.json`: The complete manifest for the Chrome Extension.

* **Code It Lacks:**
    * The document's own file structure summary shows that the code for the vast majority of the **35 backend services** and **58 frontend components** is missing.

* **Verdict:** This file contains the complete code for a handful of the most important application files but is not a complete system export.

---

### File 2: `COMPLETE_PLATFORM_SOURCE_CODE_EXPORT.md`

This document is a **more detailed partial code export** that contains the full source for several backend services.

* **Code It Contains (Complete Files):**
    * `server/index.ts`: The main server entry point.
    * `server/storage.ts`: The complete database storage layer class.
    * `server/routes.ts`: A complete version of the API routes file.
    * `server/services/auth.ts`: The complete authentication service.
    * `server/services/analytics.ts`: The complete analytics service.
    * `server/services/cache.ts`: The complete in-memory caching service.
    * `server/services/scraper.ts`: The complete web scraper service.
    * `server/services/performance-monitor.ts`: The complete performance monitoring service.
    * `server/services/debug-logger.ts`: The complete debug logging service.
    * `server/services/external-apis.ts`: The complete service for managing the 16+ external API integrations.

* **Code It Lacks:**
    * This file provides significant backend code but contains **none of the 100+ frontend components** mentioned in its overview.
    * While it shows many services, it does not contain the code for all **35 backend services** described.

* **Verdict:** This file provides the most backend source code but is missing the entire frontend and some backend services.

---

### File 3: `replit.md`

This document is a **project documentation and decision log**, not a code export.

* **Code It Contains (Illustrative Snippets Only):**
    * This file contains **no complete source code files**.
    * It includes only small, illustrative snippets to provide context for specific features, such as the CORS configuration and the `/api/signals/draft` endpoint for the Chrome extension.

* **Code It Lacks:**
    * This file lacks all application source code. Its purpose is to describe the project's history, architecture, and features in plain language.

* **Verdict:** This is a documentation file and contains no complete source code.

### Overall Summary of Code Availability

A complete source code export for the entire platform **does not exist** within these three files.

However, by combining the files, you have the **full and complete source code** for the following critical parts of the system:
* The entire **database schema** and validation (`shared/schema.ts`).
* The core **backend server, storage layer, and API routes** (`server/index.ts`, `server/storage.ts`, `server/routes.ts`).
* Several of the most important **backend services**, including authentication, OpenAI analysis, caching, and external API management.
* The main **frontend App component** (`client/src/App.tsx`).
* All necessary **configuration files** (`package.json`, `manifest.json`, etc.).

The primary missing components are the source code for the **majority of the 58+ individual frontend React components** and the remaining backend services.
