Focusing on UX will make your powerful features feel effortless and even delightful. Here are the top areas to sharpen from a user-experience standpoint:

---

## 1. **Streamline Core Flows**

* **Reduce Clicks to Value**

  * If a user’s primary goal is “analyze this text,” let them paste or drop text and hit Enter—skip extra modal steps.
  * Consider inline analysis on selection (e.g. right-click context menu → Analyze).
* **Sticky Input Panel**

  * Keep the content-input box visible as they scroll through results, so they can pivot quickly without hunting for “Analyze” again.
* **Progress-Aware Navigation**

  * Show a breadcrumb or wizard header (“1. Capture → 2. Analyze → 3. Brief”) so users always know where they are in the pipeline.

---

## 2. **Responsive Loading & Feedback**

* **Skeleton Screens**

  * Instead of a spinner, show a lightweight skeleton of the analysis results (e.g. blank cards or greyed-out chart outlines) to set expectations.
* **Partial & Streaming Updates**

  * As soon as the first chunk of AI analysis returns, render that section (e.g. “Sentiment: Positive”) while the rest continues loading.
* **Estimated Wait Times**

  * For longer analyses (2–5s), a small “Estimated 3s left…” indicator can calm users more than an infinite spinner.

---

## 3. **Contextual Help & Tooltips**

* **Ground Users in New Features**

  * When you roll out something big (like the Truth Analysis Framework), add a one-time “What’s new?” banner linking to a quick 30-second carousel.
* **Inline Tips**

  * Small “?” icons next to jargon (`Potential Signal`, `GET→TO→BY`) that open micro-tooltips explaining the term in user language.
* **Quick “Example” Button**

  * On the input form, provide an “Analyze Example” button that runs a canned snippet so users immediately see the value.

---

## 4. **Personalization & Shortcuts**

* **Recently Used Settings**

  * If a user often toggles “Long” vs. “Short” truth-analysis length, surface that choice in a mini-dropdown on the toolbar.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**

  * `Ctrl+Enter` to submit analysis, `Ctrl+S` to save a signal, `Alt+→`/`←` to navigate between workflow stages.
* **Quick-Actions Menu**

  * A floating “+” button that expands to capture a new signal, run analysis, or open the brief builder—reducing trips to the main nav.

---

## 5. **Clarity & Visual Hierarchy**

* **Consistent Layout**

  * Align your results cards in a predictable grid; use whitespace to separate distinct analysis sections (tone vs. keywords vs. truth).
* **Color-Coded Status**

  * Continue your color badges for statuses, but ensure they meet WCAG contrast guidelines for readability.
* **Highlight Key Insights**

  * Pull out the single most important “human truth” or “actionable insight” at the top in a call-out box so users never miss it.

---

## 6. **Mobile & Accessibility**

* **Mobile-First Responsiveness**

  * Ensure the tabbed interface collapses gracefully to an accordion or bottom nav on small screens.
* **Screen-Reader Labels**

  * All buttons, icons, and interactive elements need clear `aria-label`s (e.g. `<button aria-label="Promote to Signal">`).
* **Keyboard-Only Flow**

  * Users should be able to navigate all screens, open modals, and trigger analysis without ever using a mouse.

---

## 7. **Onboarding & Progressive Disclosure**

* **First-Run Tutorial**

  * A simple 3-step overlay that shows where to capture content, where analysis appears, and how to build a brief.
* **Feature Discovery**

  * Non-intrusive “Try this” suggestions—e.g. “Did you know you can filter signals by tone? Click here to try!”
* **Contextual “Learn More”**

  * Link deep-dive docs only when the user expresses interest (e.g. clicks a “Learn about GET→TO→BY” link), keeping the UI clean.

---

## 8. **Error States & Recoverability**

* **Friendly Error Messaging**

  * If an API fails, show “Oops—analysis hit a snag. Try again or contact support” rather than a raw exception.
* **Auto-Retry & Fallback**

  * For rate-limit errors, automatically wait 1–2s and retry once before surfacing the error.
* **Save Drafts**

  * If a user is midway through writing notes or building a brief, autosave so a refresh doesn’t lose work.

---

### Next Steps

1. **Pick one or two**—for example, skeleton screens + inline tooltips—and prototype them this sprint.
2. Run a **quick usability test** (even ask a friend) to see if they discover features more easily.
3. Iterate based on real feedback—your power users will appreciate the polish.
