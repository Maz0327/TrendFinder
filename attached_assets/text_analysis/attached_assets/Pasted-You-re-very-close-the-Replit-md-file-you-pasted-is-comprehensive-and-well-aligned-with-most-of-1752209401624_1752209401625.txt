You're very close ‚Äî the Replit.md file you pasted is **comprehensive** and well-aligned with most of what we've discussed. However, there are **a few key gaps**, **terminology mismatches**, and some **future-facing items** we've agreed on that aren‚Äôt reflected.

Here's a breakdown of what's ‚úÖ **accurately captured**, what's üü° **partially covered or misnamed**, and what's ‚ùå **missing or needs to be added**:

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Terminology**                  | Still uses "signal" too early ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt show full flow: `Capture ‚Üí Potential Signal ‚Üí Signal ‚Üí Insight ‚Üí Brief`     | Fix language across doc                                               |
| **Dashboard Tab Names**          | Still shows "Dashboard", "Trends", "Briefs", etc. instead of new 5-tab strategic flow                               | Update to: `Capture`, `Intelligence`, `Manage`, `Strategy`, `Execute` |
| **GET‚ÜíTO‚ÜíBY**                    | Mentioned once under components, but not emphasized as part of the strategic brief builder UX                       | Add dedicated section                                                 |
| **Cohort Builder**               | Mentioned briefly, but doesn‚Äôt explain the `7 Pillars` framework or strategic use                                   | Needs its own detailed module                                         |
| **TikTok + LinkedIn APIs**       | You mentioned they should be in the doc, but they‚Äôre not here yet                                                   | Add Phase 3 roadmap items explicitly                                  |
| **Signal Scoring via Brief Use** | The Replit doc doesn‚Äôt mention that selecting signals for briefs will inform ranking/scoring                        | Add this as Phase 2.5 or 3 in roadmap                                 |
| **Modular AI Integration**       | You said we should use OpenAI first but build the AI abstraction to later add Gemini, DeepSeek, etc. Not in doc yet | Add mention of modular `ai_service.js` layer                          |

## ‚úÖ **What You Got 100% Right**

* Security stack (bcrypt, session-based, lockouts)
* AI analysis pipeline
* Trending API architecture
* Debug/error system and UI
* Export options
* Truth-based progression (fact ‚Üí insight ‚Üí human truth)
* UI/UX improvements for clarity and navigation
* Slides/PPT export format
* Authentication bug fixes
* Real-time data integration success
* Signal validation & content audit system

## Summary

Your current document is:

* ‚úÖ **\~85‚Äì90% complete and accurate**
* üü° **Missing several key renamed concepts and features we discussed**
* ‚ùå **Lacking newer roadmap integrations and workflow refinements**

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1. ‚úÖ **Generate a fully updated `Replit.md` document** that reflects **every part** of this analysis?
2. ‚úÖ **Include updated terminology, modules, API plans, feature map, and future roadmap** inside that file?
3. ‚úÖ Provide it as a downloadable `.md` or `.txt`?

Let me know and I‚Äôll prep it now.
