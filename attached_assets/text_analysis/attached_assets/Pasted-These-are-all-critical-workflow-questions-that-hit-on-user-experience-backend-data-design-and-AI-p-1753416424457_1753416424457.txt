These are all critical workflow questions that hit on user experience, backend data design, and AI processing. Let’s break them down piece by piece with solid answers, practical recommendations, and a clear vision of how everything fits together.

🗃️ 1. Where does captured content go after the Chrome Extension?

➤ Captured Content = Stored as “Signals-in-Progress” in a Session/Project
	•	Each user-initiated capture (screenshot, page, text, etc.) is saved in a “Project” or “Session”.
	•	Every item becomes a “Signal Draft” with the following attached metadata:

{
  "capture_id": "uuid",
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "type": "screenshot" | "text" | "url" | "video-frame",
  "source_url": "https://...",
  "note": "User note here",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-18T13:05:00Z",
  "tags": ["rival-content", "platform-behavior"],
  "raw_text": "Extracted OCR / transcript",
  "image_path": "/media/capture_7.png",
  "gemini_annotation": {
    "content_type": "video-comment",
    "content_summary": "...",
    "suggested_section": "culturalMoment"
  }
}



Everything lives together inside the project like a folder, ready for analysis and review.

🧭 2. How do we organize it visually for the user (so they don’t do double work)?

✅ Recommended UI/UX: Pinterest-style Kanban or Gallery View

Each card = a capture with:
	•	Image preview (if screenshot)
	•	Title auto-generated by system ("TikTok comment sentiment spike")
	•	Suggested tags
	•	Suggested template section (e.g. “This may belong in Human Truth”)
	•	Inline notes + editable fields
	•	Quick “Send to Brief Draft” toggle

Filter & sort options:
	•	By tag
	•	By source
	•	By media type
	•	By time
	•	By suggested brief section

📌 Goal: Let users quickly review, edit if they want, and push content directly into the brief.

🧠 3. How does the system link screenshots to the text?

🔧 Answer: Session ID + OCR + Timestamp

Each screenshot is:
	•	Paired with its raw OCR text using Gemini 2.5 Pro
	•	Tagged with session + scroll context
	•	Optionally paired with any user notes or active page URL

The system uses:
	•	File name or image hash
	•	Capture metadata (source URL, viewport)
	•	User session timeline (i.e., what did they do before/after?)

Result: Gemini sees the image + text + user context and can intelligently map where this belongs in the brief.

🎥 4. How do we differentiate between content types (comment vs. overlay vs. caption etc)?

💡 Solution: Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for Visual Context + Prompt Logic

Gemini 2.5 Pro can:
	•	Detect on-screen UI patterns like:
	•	TikTok comment overlays
	•	YouTube video titles
	•	Instagram carousels
	•	Captions vs. speaker names
	•	Extract semantic meaning (e.g., “this is a sarcastic viewer comment under a comedy video”)

⸻

✅ Prompt Example:

“Analyze this screenshot. Classify what type of content is being shown. Is it a video frame? A user comment? A brand caption? A quote overlay? Summarize it briefly and label its type.”

You’ll get something like:

{
  "content_type": "user-comment",
  "detected_platform": "TikTok",
  "text": "This is hilarious 😂 I totally relate",
  "summary": "Comment expressing shared humor from viewer",
  "suggested_tag": "human-truth"
}


⸻

🧩 5. How can we make the user workflow intuitive so this doesn’t feel like manual tagging?

✔️ Smart UX Design:
	•	Auto-classify on capture (e.g., “This looks like a video with a meme caption”)
	•	Suggest section in the brief: “This would work well in ‘Human Truth’”
	•	Batch accept all or review only flagged ones
	•	Tag via icons: 🎥 = video, 💬 = comment, 🖼️ = meme, 📍 = local trend

User flow is: Browse → Capture → Review panel later → Approve and auto-fill brief

⸻

🔍 Bonus: Gemini 2.5 Pro Confidence Ranking

You can request a confidence score from Gemini in identifying:
	•	Content type
	•	Platform
	•	Sentiment
	•	Brief section match

Only send low-confidence results to human review.

⸻

TL;DR — Final Workflow Recap:
	1.	Capture: Screenshots or text → saved with metadata and auto-OCR
	2.	Classify: Gemini identifies content type and recommends brief section + tags
	3.	Review Panel: User sees “cards” with previews, tags, notes, and suggested placements
	4.	Batch Accept or Edit: Easy flow to move content to brief
	5.	Compile Brief: Final content is edited, then AI writes transitions, titles, and exports to Slides
