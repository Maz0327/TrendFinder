Based on my review of the replit.md file, here are the additional suggestions that were NOT already specified for future builds:

üîß Technical Improvements Not Yet Planned
1. Database & Performance Optimizations
Database query optimization with proper indexing for large datasets
Schema optimization - The current signals table has 43 fields (many unused) causing database bloat
Component consolidation to reduce the 88 useState/useEffect hooks for better performance
2. Production Readiness
Console logging cleanup - Remove 10+ console.log statements in production code
API response caching using Redis or in-memory caching to prevent rate limiting
Retry mechanisms for failed API calls with exponential backoff
3. Code Quality & Maintenance
OpenAI service refactoring - Break down the 125-line prompt with nested conditional logic into smaller functions
Service layer simplification - Streamline the 16+ external API services with unified configuration
Error boundary improvements - Add comprehensive error boundaries across all components
üåê Additional APIs & Platforms Not in Future Roadmap
Free/Open Source APIs Missing from Plans
Glasp.co - Highlights of what users are saving on the web
BuzzSumo (limited) - Trending content per keyword or domain
Nitter (self-hosted) - Open-source proxy for Twitter/X data
Pushshift.io - Reddit archive access for historical trend analysis
rss.app integrations - TikTok, Twitter, LinkedIn via RSS proxy
Enhanced Monitoring & Testing
Automated testing suite for API integrations
Content quality scoring algorithms
Signal validation and quality control systems
Performance benchmarking tools
User behavior analytics and usage patterns
üìä Advanced Features Not in Current Roadmap
1. Strategic Intelligence Enhancements
Viral potential prediction algorithms beyond current scoring
Advanced cohort building with behavioral data analysis
ROI tracking for implemented strategies
Citation management system for research provenance
2. User Experience Improvements
Advanced export formats (PDF, PowerPoint automation)
Brief generation with multiple professional templates
Advanced source credibility scoring algorithms
Automatic source categorization and reliability assessment
3. System Intelligence
API health monitoring with automatic failover
System stability monitoring and alerts
Real-time performance monitoring dashboard beyond current debug system
These represent genuine gaps that were identified in the system audit and planning documents but are not currently included in the Phase 3 roadmap. They focus on production readiness, code quality, and advanced intelligence features that could significantly enhance the platform's reliability and capabilities.
