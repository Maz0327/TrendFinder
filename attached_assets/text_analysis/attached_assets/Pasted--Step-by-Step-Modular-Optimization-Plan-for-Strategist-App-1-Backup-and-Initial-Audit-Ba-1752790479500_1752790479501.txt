# Step-by-Step Modular Optimization Plan for Strategist-App

## 1. **Backup and Initial Audit**
- Backup your codebase and database.
- List all current features (truth analysis, cohorts, competitive insights, dashboards, etc.).

---

## 2. **Identify Core vs Advanced Features**
- **Core:** Truth analysis, content submission, signals dashboard, user auth.
- **Advanced:** Cohort builder, competitive intelligence, analytics, export tools, etc.
- Mark all advanced features for modularization (not removal).

---

## 3. **Backend Modularization**
- Move each advanced feature into its own service/module/file (e.g., `services/cohortBuilder.ts`, `services/competitiveIntelligence.ts`).
- Only load/execute advanced features when directly requested (not as part of every request).
- Keep core analysis API (`POST /api/analyze`) as fast and simple as possible.

---

## 4. **Optimize OpenAI & External API Calls**
- Add caching (in-memory/Redis) per content+type for all AI analysis results.
- Use concise, clear prompts for each AI feature.
- For heavy/optional features, run analysis in the background and notify users when ready rather than blocking the main flow.
- Implement exponential backoff and error handling for all API calls.

---

## 5. **Frontend Modularization**
- Split each advanced feature into a lazily loaded React component or page (e.g., `CohortBuilder`, `CompetitiveInsights`).
- The main dashboard should only load core truth analysis and signals by default.
- Use code-splitting (`React.lazy`, dynamic imports) so advanced features only load when accessed.
- Add clear loading/error states to each module.

---

## 6. **State Management & Hooks**
- Move feature-specific state/hooks into their module/component (avoid giant global state).
- Share only minimal user/session/context between modules.

---

## 7. **Database & Schema**
- Keep tables for all features, but only JOIN/fetch related data when the relevant module is loaded.
- For seldom-used analytics, store results in a separate table, not in the main signals table.

---

## 8. **Testing and Error Boundaries**
- Wrap each advanced/lazy module in a React Error Boundary.
- Add backend try/catch and user-friendly error responses for every feature API.

---

## 9. **Performance & Monitoring**
- Add monitoring for API response times, cache hits/misses, and error rates.
- Set up alerts for any endpoint or module that exceeds a latency/error threshold.

---

## 10. **Documentation and Code Comments**
- Document which features are core and which are modular.
- Clearly label modules/files as “core” or “advanced/optional”.

---

## Example: Modular Cohort Builder

```typescript name=services/cohortBuilder.ts
export async function getCohortSuggestions(content: string) {
  // Only run when cohort builder explicitly called
  // Use cache and concise prompt
}
```

```tsx name=client/src/components/CohortBuilder.tsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
const CohortBuilder = React.lazy(() => import("./CohortBuilderImpl"));
export default function LazyCohortBuilder(props) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Cohort Builder...</div>}>
      <CohortBuilder {...props} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

---

## 11. **Final Testing & Verification**
- Test the app as a new user: core flow should be instant, advanced features load on demand.
- Confirm all features still work, but none slow down the core truth analysis or dashboard.

---

## 12. **Ongoing Maintenance**
- When adding new features: always make them modular, lazy-loaded, and backgrounded if heavy.
- Regularly monitor performance and refactor any slow feature into a background service or separate module.

---

**Summary:**  
This plan keeps ALL implemented features, but makes each one modular, optional, and non-blocking for the core user experience. You keep maximum strategic power—without performance or complexity drag.
