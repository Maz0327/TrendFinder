## 📌 Addendum: Missing Feature Coverage (Patch for Replit.md)

This section patches key omissions from the original Replit.md document to ensure complete alignment with our POC architecture and conversation history. No previously written content is modified.

### 🧠 System Suggestions Tab
- An AI-generated suggestions interface that identifies and recommends Potential Signals based on analysis results.
- Provides reasoning (e.g. "This shows unique consumer behavior"), priority level, and timestamp.
- Part of the signal validation workflow.

### 🔼 Promotion System: Capture → Potential Signal → Signal
- Manual and AI-based promotion workflow embedded in dashboard and analysis result view.
- Users can "Promote" content status via contextual buttons with in-app explanations.
- System tracks timestamps and stores rationale (user or AI-provided) in the database.

### 📍 "Flag as Worth Researching" Workflow
- Post-analysis, users can flag content with one-click interface.
- Automatically sets status to "Potential Signal."
- Promotes user-driven discovery and strategy refinement.

### 📚 Source Management System
- Tracks and stores all URLs processed during capture.
- Assigns metadata: domain, category, trust level, favicon.
- Links all signals and insights back to their source for auditability and research depth.
- Users can rate source reliability and view top domains.

### 🪶 Build Slim / Build Later Indicators
- Noted in internal modules but not present in Replit.md.
- Clarifies which systems are MVP-critical vs deferred (e.g. analytics dashboard = later).
- Promotes clean, focused dev and scoping for testers.

### 📉 Reactive Opportunity Engine
- Captures trending moments with urgency scoring (Critical/High/Medium).
- Converts real-time signals into content ideas based on platform-specific virality.
- Highlights Bridge-Worthy opportunities from trend ingestion.

### 🖼️ Slide Export (Google Slides Format)
- In addition to markdown/HTML brief exports, allows export of slide-ready formats.
- Ideal for presentations and pitch decks.
- Uses structured, branded templates with key insight breakdowns.

### 🔍 Platform Filtering in Trends Tab
- Platform-specific filtering enabled (e.g. YouTube, Reddit, Google Trends).
- Two modes: 3-per-platform (All) vs 20-from-one (Focus).
- Allows deeper investigation per source.

### 📈 Lightweight Analytics & Logging (Build Slim)
- Tracks saves, exports, and promotions via console logs.
- Logs format: `{ eventType, userId, metadata, timestamp }`
- Build Later: Adds Supabase storage and usage dashboard.
