Based on the **‚ÄúJimmy John's PAC Drop #8‚Äù** presentation and your goal of automating brief building while aligning screenshots, analysis, and insights, here‚Äôs a breakdown of:

## üîç What‚Äôs Most Important in the Jimmy John‚Äôs Deck

This doc is a **signal-first** creative deck built around cultural moments and audience behavior. The brief format is modular and highly visual, often grounded in:

### 1. **Content Signals with Engagement Data**

* Impressions, benchmark comparison
* TikTok and Instagram links
* Qual scores (e.g., "TT QUAL SCORE: A")

### 2. **Cultural & Platform Signals**

* ‚ÄúC‚Äù Signals = Cultural trends (e.g., girl-to-girl advice, adult friendships)
* ‚ÄúP‚Äù Signals = Psychographic/behavioral audience segments (e.g., sauce enthusiasts, stoners, moms)

### 3. **Opportunities + Ideation**

* Each slide moves from trend ‚Üí opportunity ‚Üí ideation (with bullet point thought starters)

### 4. **Audience Cohorts**

* Repeated categorization of audience by:

  * Life stage (post-grad, moms, 30+)
  * Behavior (repeat buyers, emotionally-driven buyers)
  * Humor/archetypes (stoners, sauce lovers, drama lovers)

### 5. **Social Content Examples (Screenshots + Links)**

* Screenshots or embeds of TikToks/IG posts
* Looping visuals, sticky note CTAs, jokes
* Strong use of **meme culture and tone** (funny, chaotic, cheeky)

## üß† Workflow Plan to Automate & Structure These Decks

To automate this while keeping screenshots and insights aligned, here‚Äôs what the workflow should do:

### 1. **Organize Captures by Project + Section**

* User starts a capture session for a project (e.g. ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs Day 2025‚Äù)
* Each screenshot or highlight is tagged with:

  * **Template Section** (C Signal, P Signal, Opportunity, Insight, Idea)
  * Optional: Qual Score / Platform (if known)

### 2. **Auto-Tagging via Prompt System**

When a user adds a note or capture, AI auto-detects:

* **C Signal** vs. **P Signal** vs. **Tactical Trend**
* If it's **performance data**, group under ‚ÄúIn-Market Performance‚Äù
* If it's a **visual/meme/screenshot**, sort under ‚ÄúPlatform Signal‚Äù or ‚ÄúExample‚Äù

> ‚úÖ Bonus: If the user inputs a video link (e.g. TikTok), AI fetches the transcript or audio analysis and suggests what section it fits in.

### 3. **Screenshot Normalization + Pairing**

* During capture, the system records **context** (site, title, timestamp, user note)
* AI suggests:

  * Which insight it connects to (e.g. ‚ÄúMom wants a me-day‚Äù connects to a meme screenshot showing ‚Äúgift basket of nothing‚Äù)
  * If multiple screenshots fit one insight, arrange them in **carousel/grid** in Google Slides
* Normalize sizing:

  * Horizontal images get placed in side-by-side layouts
  * Vertical images are centered and padded with background

## üß± Google Slides Template Structure (Based on the Jimmy John‚Äôs Doc)

Start with a master template that includes:

| Section                   | Content Type                    | Automation Approach         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| In-Market Performance     | Numbers + engagement benchmarks | Populate from user tags     |
| Platform/Cultural Signals | Screenshots + notes             | Auto-sort from session data |
| Opportunities             | Text insights (AI-suggested)    | Extract from note metadata  |
| Ideation (Let‚Äôs Ideate)   | Bullet ideas                    | AI-assisted generation      |
| Audience Cohorts          | Auto-grouped by psychographics  | From tagged metadata        |
| CTA Suggestions           | Sticky notes / caption text     | Optional AI injection       |
| Voice to Watch            | Handle + platform + links       | Pull from saved handles     |

## üß† How to Prioritize Info

When multiple pieces of content are captured, prioritize:

1. **High engagement posts (or flagged by user as ‚Äúhigh signal‚Äù)**
2. **Posts with commentary from target cohorts (e.g. moms, stoners, Gen Z)**
3. **Content that‚Äôs part of a trend (detected via keywords or loop detection)**

## ‚úÖ Summary of Key System Improvements

| Area                    | Recommendation                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Organizing Sessions** | Use Project ID + Section Tags (Replit was right)                       |
| **Screenshot Handling** | Normalize sizes, tag with insight, allow reordering                    |
| **Insight Mapping**     | Auto-match screenshot to insight by user note or keyword proximity     |
| **Export Structure**    | Fill default GSlides template with placeholders that match this format |
| **User Experience**     | Auto-suggest template section after capture; allow manual override     |

Would you like a proposed **slide-by-slide default template layout** to use as our baseline for this automation engine?
