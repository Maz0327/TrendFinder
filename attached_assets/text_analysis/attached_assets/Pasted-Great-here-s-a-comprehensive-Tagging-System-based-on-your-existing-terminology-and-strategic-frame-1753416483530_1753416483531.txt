Great ‚Äî here‚Äôs a comprehensive Tagging System based on your existing terminology and strategic framework. The goal is to let users quickly tag captured content in the Chrome extension or dashboard so the system can accurately route it to the right Truth Analysis category and eventually organize it in the final brief.

üîó Tagging UX Tip

Tags should be:
	‚Ä¢	Available in the Chrome Extension at capture time
	‚Ä¢	Editable in the dashboard under each capture
	‚Ä¢	Suggestive (use AI to recommend common tags based on content type)
	‚Ä¢	Optional but encouraged (increases routing precision)

Would you like help mapping this into:
	1.	JSON schema or database structure for captures
	2.	Tag suggestion logic using content heuristics
	3.	UI design for how tagging should appear in the extension/dashboard

Or should we move on to implementing tagging logic in the backend pipeline next?
