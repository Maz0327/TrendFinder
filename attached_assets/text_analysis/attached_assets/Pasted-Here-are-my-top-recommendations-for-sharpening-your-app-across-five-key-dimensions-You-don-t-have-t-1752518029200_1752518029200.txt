Here are my top recommendations for sharpening your app across five key dimensions. You don’t have to do them all at once—pick the ones that’ll move the needle most for you:

---

## 1. **Code Organization & Maintainability**

* **Extract shared types & utils** into a `shared/` package (or folder)
  Keeps both `client/` and `server/` from re-implementing the same schemas or helper functions—and makes refactoring frictionless.
* **Group documentation** under a `/docs` directory
  Move all your markdown (Replit.md, design docs, API references) into `/docs` so the root stays focused on code.
* **Adopt a consistent import alias** (e.g. `@shared`, `@services`) via your TS config
  Avoids brittle relative imports like `../../../types` and makes it obvious when you’re crossing layer boundaries.
* **Define a clear module boundary** for “AI logic” vs “data logic” vs “presentation logic”
  Consider sub-folders like `services/analysis/`, `services/persistence/`, and `controllers/` to make responsibilities explicit.

---

## 2. **Performance & Cost Optimization**

* **Cache external API results** (Google Trends, NewsAPI, OpenAI responses) with a short TTL
  Even an in-memory LRU or Redis cache will cut your token usage and speed up repeat calls.
* **Rate-limit your endpoints** (e.g. `express-rate-limit`)
  Protects you from accidental flood of requests (and runaway OpenAI spend).
* **Offload heavy work to a job queue** (BullMQ + Redis or Replit Scheduled Jobs)
  For multi-platform data pulls or batch analysis, enqueue the job and return a “processing” status instead of blocking the request.
* **Lazy-load large React pages**
  Use `React.lazy` + `Suspense` for screens like BriefBuilder or CohortBuilder to reduce your initial bundle and speed up first paint.
* **Tree-shake and purge unused Tailwind classes**
  Configure PurgeCSS or Tailwind’s JIT mode so your CSS payload stays under control.

---

## 3. **Security & Reliability**

* **Shift sessions to Redis (or another external store)**
  Built-in memory store can lose sessions on restart. Redis gives you sticky sessions and scales beyond a single process.
* **Harden your HTTP headers**
  Add HSTS, Content Security Policy, and remove any `X-Powered-By: Express` header so you’re not advertising your tech stack.
* **Validate & sanitize all inputs** server-side with Zod
  Don’t trust the client—replay attacks or malformed payloads can slip through if you only validate in React.
* **Audit your scraped content** for XSS
  If you ever render HTML you’ve pulled via Cheerio, sanitize it (DOMPurify or sanitize-html) before injecting it into your React tree.
* **Lock down CORS** to only your front-end origin in production
  Prevent other websites from hitting your API with forged requests.

---

## 4. **Quality Assurance & Developer Experience**

* **Add automated tests** with Vitest or Jest

  * **Unit tests** for core utilities (prompt builders, sentiment parsers)
  * **Integration tests** for Express routes (use `supertest` + a mocked DB or test DB)
* **Enable linting & formatting** in CI

  * E.g. ESLint + Prettier on every PR via GitHub Actions
  * Catch type errors, style inconsistencies, and unused imports before they merge.
* **Publish an OpenAPI (Swagger) spec** for your REST API

  * Front-end and external integrators can autogenerate types/clients and avoid “breaking changes.”
* **Use Docker** (even locally) for reproducible environments

  * Ensures everyone on the team runs the same Node version, environment variables, and start commands.

---

## 5. **Monitoring, Observability & Scaling**

* **Integrate a lightweight APM** (Datadog/Elastic/APM) or at least structured logging (Winston/Pino + a log shipper)
  Track request times, error rates, and OpenAI API latencies in one dashboard.
* **Expose health-check & metrics endpoints**

  * `/healthz` for uptime checks
  * `/metrics` (Prometheus) for CPU, memory, request counts, and custom counters
* **Set up alerts** on error rate spikes or slow OpenAI calls
  Avoid downtime or runaway bills by automatically notifying you if something goes sideways.
* **Plan for horizontal scaling** via micro-services or splitting
  If you hit resource limits on Replit, you can isolate:

  * AI requests in one service
  * Trend ingestion in another
  * Front-end SSR (or static) in another

---

### Next Steps

1. Pick **one** or **two** high-impact items (caching + rate-limiting, or tests + CI) and implement them right away.
2. Measure the wins—less API cost, faster loads, fewer bugs.
3. Gradually tackle the rest, prioritizing what delivers the most reliability or developer velocity.

Let me know which area you’d like sample code or a deeper walkthrough for—cache middleware, job-queue setup, test scaffolding, or anything else!
