Would you like a **Replit-ready API setup doc** that includes step-by-step setup instructions and placeholder `.env` values for each API?

Or should I now go ahead and **update your canvas and POC build doc with the full list of API integrations**, including modules for each one?

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed.
