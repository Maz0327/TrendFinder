Perfect — starting with #5: Comment Mining, and adapting it to the MVP reality of your system. Here’s a lean, realistic plan that avoids scraping but still builds strategic value from user-captured content:

⸻

🧩 Problem

You want insights from comment sections (which are rich in cultural signals, humor, human truth, etc.), but:
	•	Scraping is too unstable for MVP
	•	Not every capture will include comment data
	•	You still want to get strategic value from the kinds of things users are seeing

⸻

✅ Lean MVP Strategy (No Scraping)

🔸 Step 1: Let Users Capture Comments Manually (Visually or Text)

In the Chrome extension, add this option when a user saves a post:

“Include Comments?”
	•	✅ If yes, allow two input types:
	•	Screenshot (of visible comments)
	•	Text box to paste top 1–3 comments manually

This keeps it simple — if they think comments matter, they’ll save them.

⸻

🔸 Step 2: Introduce a Tag Type for Comments

In both:
	•	Chrome extension UI
	•	Captured Content section in dashboard

Add tag options like:
	•	comment-insight
	•	comment-trend
	•	comment-emotion
	•	audience-voice
	•	funny-comment
	•	toxic-comment
	•	ask-to-analyze-comment

Each tag helps the system understand:
	•	The role of the comment (insight, trend, humor)
	•	Where it might fit in the brief (Human Truth, Cultural Moment, Viral Trigger, etc.)

⸻

🔸 Step 3: Automatically Route to Truth Analysis

In backend logic:
	•	If content (or a comment screenshot/paste) is tagged as comment-related,
	•	Trigger GPT/Gemini analysis to:
	•	Detect patterns (e.g. repetition of sentiment, joke formats)
	•	Assign it to the correct section (e.g. Human Truth or Cultural Moment)
	•	Score it for “Virality”, “Tension”, or “Trend Spark”

If you’re using Gemini for visual OCR:
	•	You can feed comment screenshots into Gemini to extract actual text
	•	Then route that text to GPT-4o for deeper Truth Analysis

⸻

🔸 Step 4: Let User Add Summary Note (Optional)

Give users a field to summarize what they think the comments are saying. You can then:
	•	Feed that into GPT analysis for clarity
	•	Train the system over time to trust well-tagged and noted comments

⸻

🔸 Step 5: Store Comments as Sub-Captures

In DB:
	•	Treat comments as attached content to a parent capture
	•	Useful for future logic (e.g. AI “remembers” this capture got big engagement)

💡 Benefits of This MVP Strategy

Benefit	Why It Works
No scraping	Avoids TOS/legal/API issues for TikTok, IG, YT
Leverages user judgment	Strategist curates what’s worth saving
Makes comment data analyzable	Tagging + Gemini + GPT loop
Fits existing flow	Just adds 1–2 extra fields to extension & dashboard
Sets foundation for automation	Later you can auto-tag patterns once enough data is collected

Let me know if you want me to help you:
	1.	Design the database schema for “attached comments”
	2.	Write the prompt for analyzing comment text
	3.	Design the tag system UI (extension and dashboard)
