Got it ‚Äî this is a common issue with GPT models when using the API. Even if your prompt says ‚Äú7‚Äì10 sentences,‚Äù the model often defaults to short responses unless multiple enforcement techniques are layered.

To fix this, we need to combine semantic reinforcement, prompt structure tricks, and soft penalization of short outputs. Here‚Äôs how to solve it:

‚úÖ Final Working Prompt Fix (GPT-4o Deep Analysis)

üí° What‚Äôs different:
	‚Ä¢	Reframes the intent and tone for GPT-4o as a writer, not just a labeler
	‚Ä¢	Adds a target sentence length hint inside each field description
	‚Ä¢	Reinforces that short responses are invalid
	‚Ä¢	Uses response_format: "json_object" to keep it clean

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Updated Prompt Format (copy/paste-ready)

const systemPrompt = `
You are a senior content strategist writing deep cultural and strategic analysis. 
Only return valid JSON with full sentences for each field. 
Each field should feel like a well-written paragraph with real insight and flow. 
Write around 7 sentences per field. Do not go under 6. You can go up to 10 if needed.
If a response is too short or lacks detail, it is not valid.
Do not include markdown, labels, or commentary.
`;

const userPrompt = {
  role: "user",
  content: `Schema:
{
  "truthAnalysis": {
    "fact": "string",              // A detailed factual summary, 6‚Äì10 full sentences
    "observation": "string",       // What patterns you noticed, 6‚Äì10 full sentences
    "insight": "string",           // What this reveals strategically, 6‚Äì10 full sentences
    "humanTruth": "string",        // What this shows about people‚Äôs motivations, 6‚Äì10 full sentences
    "culturalMoment": "string"     // Why this matters in today's culture, 6‚Äì10 full sentences
  }
}
Analyze the following content deeply. Fill each field with strategic depth. Return only valid JSON:
Title: ${title}
Content: ${content}`
};

‚úÖ API Call (unchanged except max_tokens set high)

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  temperature: 0.7,
  top_p: 1,
  max_tokens: 1600, // Increased for breathing room
  response_format: "json_object",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
    userPrompt
  ]
});

üß† Pro Tip: Add Output Verification

After generation, check the sentence count in code. If it‚Äôs under 6, re-prompt it with:

‚ÄúThat response was too short. Please rewrite using 7‚Äì10 full sentences per field.‚Äù

This loop improves consistency dramatically in production systems.

Would you like me to wrap this in a reusable helper so you can plug it into your backend directly?
