## Overview

This is a full-stack strategic content intelligence platform built with React and Express, providing advanced AI-powered content analysis using OpenAI's GPT-4. The application enables users to capture content from URLs (especially social media like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok), analyze it using a Truth Analysis framework for strategic insights, and manage content progression through a signal promotion system (Capture â†’ Potential Signal â†’ Signal â†’ Validated Signal).

The platform's business vision is to deliver authentic trending content and cultural intelligence, offering strategic advantages by understanding the complete visual culture context that drives consumer behavior and competitive positioning. Key capabilities include:
- AI-powered content analysis (GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro).
- Real-time content capture from various platforms using advanced scraping techniques (Bright Data integration).
- Signal management and workflow for promoting content from raw capture to validated signals.
- Automated brief generation and Google Slides integration.
- Comprehensive visual intelligence for brand, cultural, and competitive analysis.
- Advanced AI tiering system (Quick Mode: GPT-4o-mini; Deep Mode: GPT-4o).
- Chrome extension for frictionless content capture and voice notes.

## System Architecture

The platform follows a modular, scalable architecture emphasizing clean design and performance.

**Frontend Architecture:**
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript.
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling.
- **State Management**: React Query for server state.
- **Routing**: Single-page application with conditional rendering.
- **Build Tool**: Vite.
- **UI/UX Decisions**:
    - **Color Schemes**: Professional gradients and consistent blue theme.
    - **Templates**: Jimmy John's-style brief template (Performance â†’ Cultural Signals â†’ Platform Signals â†’ Opportunities â†’ Cohorts â†’ Ideation).
    - **Design Approaches**: Modern, clean interface with professional gradients, smooth animations, visual hierarchy, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile (touch-optimized interfaces, fixed bottom navigation, safe area support).
    - **Space Optimization**: Reduced header (48px) and sidebar (192px, collapsible to 48px) for maximum working space.
    - **One Tool, One Place**: Streamlined navigation with 5 strategic workflow tabs (Today's Briefing, Explore Signals, New Signal Capture, Strategic Brief Lab, Manage).
    - **Loading States**: Standardized across all components with real progress tracking.

**Backend Architecture:**
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Session Management**: Express sessions for authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Modularity**: Monolithic routes separated into specialized modules (e.g., authRoutes, signalRoutes, analysisRoutes).
- **Validation**: Zod for 100% request body and query parameter validation.
- **Error Handling**: Consistent API response format with user-friendly error messages and actionable solutions.
- **Authentication**: Session-based, strong password hashing (bcryptjs), protected routes, rate limiting for brute force protection.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for OpenAI analysis endpoints (20 requests/min, 500/day) and general API endpoints (100 requests/min).
- **Content Chunking**: Intelligent system for processing unlimited content lengths by splitting, processing, and combining results.
- **Comment Limiting**: Intelligent sampling and configurable limits to prevent system overload from large comment threads.
- **API Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of internal and external API calls for performance, cost, and usage.
- **Source Traceability**: Every signal references at least one source or is marked as manual entry.
- **AI Tiering**:
    - **Quick Mode**: GPT-4o-mini for 2-4 sentence analysis.
