Niceâ€”thanks for the link. I took a pass over `TrendFinder` and hereâ€™s what stands out (prioritized):

## ðŸ”´ Critical

* **Secrets/cookies committed.** Tons of cookie/session artifacts are versioned at the repo root (`cookies.txt`, `dashboard_test_cookies.txt`, `filter_*_cookies.txt`, `final_*_cookies.txt`, `test_*_cookies.txt`, etc.). These can leak auth and cause bans. Purge from history and rotate anything they touched. ([GitHub][1])
* **Large/binary junk tracked.** `attached_assets/` and build/test artifacts are in Git. Move to releases or ignore. ([GitHub][1])

## ðŸŸ  Structural/DX

* **Monorepo-ish layout** is good (`server/`, `client/`, `shared/`)â€”just make sure your root scripts orchestrate both apps (concurrently), and that `shared/` is consumed cleanly (tsconfig path alias or a local package). ([GitHub][1])
* **Drizzle present** (`drizzle.config.ts`). Double-check `out` dir and migration scripts exist/are used in CI. ([GitHub][1])
* **Chrome extension** code is included. Keep it isolated with its own build/test scripts and exclude packaged zips from Git. Also keep `manifest.json` permissions tight. ([GitHub][1])
* **Replit config** exists (`.replit`). Make sure it doesnâ€™t conflict with local dev scripts. ([GitHub][1])
* **Languages:** Mostly TypeScript (\~90%), with some JS/CSS and a touch of Python. Good to standardize on TS if possible. ([GitHub][1])

## âœ… Quick fixes you can do now

1. **Harden `.gitignore`** (keep yours, but add these lines if missing):

```
# universal
.DS_Store
*.log
.env
*.local

# node/build
node_modules/
dist/
build/
.cache/
.vite/

# replit/temp/assets
.replit
attached_assets/

# test artifacts, cookies, sessions
*cookie*.txt
cookies.txt
```

2. **Untrack what slipped in:**

```bash
git rm -r --cached attached_assets \
  "*.log" "*.zip" "*.tar.gz" "*.jar" \
  "*.local" \
  cookies.txt "*cookie*.txt"
git commit -m "chore(repo): stop tracking assets/logs/cookies"
```

3. **Purge secrets from history (recommended):**

* If you can install it:

```bash
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path cookies.txt --path-glob "*cookie*.txt"
```

* Or use **BFG Repo-Cleaner** with a glob.
  Then **force-push** and **rotate** any impacted tokens/cookies immediately.

4. **Add an `.env.example`** with every required var (server + client + extension) so fresh setups donâ€™t silently fail.

5. **Root `package.json` scripts** (if youâ€™re not already doing this) to orchestrate dev:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently -k \"npm:dev-*\"",
    "dev-server": "npm --workspace server run dev",
    "dev-client": "npm --workspace client run dev",
    "typecheck": "tsc -b",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
```

6. **CI sanity (GitHub Actions)** â€” catches breakages early:

```yaml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm run lint
```

## ðŸ§ª Runtime reliability (common pain points I see in repos like this)

* Set **per-request timeouts + retry w/ backoff** for all fetchers (news APIs, social APIs, etc.).
* Use **keep-alive** agents for HTTP(S) to reduce socket churn.
* Add **observability**: log URL, status, duration, and error cause per outbound call.
* Separate long jobs into a **queue/worker** (BullMQ + Redis) and cap overall job time budgets.

If you want, point me at any specific file youâ€™re worried about (e.g., `server/src/index.ts`, `shared/â€¦`, or the extensionâ€™s `manifest.json`) and Iâ€™ll do a deeper line-by-line with exact diffs. For now, your top priority is: **remove/purge the cookie files and rotate credentials**. Everything else is cleanup and DX. ([GitHub][1])
