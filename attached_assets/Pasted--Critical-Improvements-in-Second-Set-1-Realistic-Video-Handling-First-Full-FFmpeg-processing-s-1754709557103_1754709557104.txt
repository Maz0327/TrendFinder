‚ö° Critical Improvements in Second Set
1. Realistic Video Handling

First: "Full FFmpeg processing, scene detection" ‚ùå
Second: "Export timestamps + edit lists for manual editing" ‚úÖ
Why Better: Avoids massive compute costs while delivering 80% of value
2. Smarter Database Usage

First: "Add everything to your existing DB"
Second: "Leverage Supabase pgvector, cron, Edge Functions"
Why Better: Offloads heavy lifting to managed services
3. Manual-First Approach

First: "Full automation with APIs"
Second: "CSV exports, manual boost setup"
Why Better: Matches your cost-conscious approach and avoids API complexity
4. Concrete Schema

First: Conceptual descriptions
Second: Copy-paste ready SQL with specific field types
Why Better: You can implement TODAY
üö´ What Second Set Wisely Avoids
Heavy automation (competitive SOV tracking)
Direct ad platform APIs (complex approvals)
Real-time webhook consumers (Replit sleeping issue)
Video rendering (FFmpeg/ML processing)
Complex approval workflows (enterprise overhead)
üí° My Recommendation: Go with Second Set + Modifications
The second set is far superior for your current situation because:

Respects Replit Constraints: Works within platform limitations
Maintains Cost Control: Uses cheap embeddings vs expensive APIs
Preserves Your Philosophy: Manual scanning, strategic thinking over automation
Actionable Timeline: 1-2 weeks vs months
Incremental Value: Each feature works independently
üé¨ Suggested Implementation Order
Week 1 (Must Have):

Client Profiles + pgvector embeddings
Brand Fit scoring
Basic PAC-Drop to Markdown/Sheets
Week 2 (High Value):

Lightweight Reverse-Pyramid (timestamps only)
Quote Bank extraction
Manual Boost Planner CSV
Week 3 (Nice to Have):

Simple Sprint board
SLA timers with Supabase cron
Slack webhook for captures
‚ö†Ô∏è Why First Set Would Fail
Replit Can't Handle: Video processing, always-on workers, heavy compute
Cost Explosion: Competitive APIs, video storage, real-time tracking
Over-Engineering: Approval workflows for solo operator
Maintenance Burden: 12 complex features = constant debugging
‚úÖ The Winner Is Clear
The second set transforms your tool into a client-focused intelligence platform without breaking your architecture or budget. It's the difference between:

First Set: "Let's rebuild Hootsuite + Premiere + Monday.com"
Second Set: "Let's make your existing tool 10x more valuable with smart enhancements"
The second approach respects that you built a "second brain for strategic intelligence", not an enterprise automation platform. It adds precision (client fit) and speed (PAC drops) without complexity bloat.

Bottom Line: Implement the second set's green-light features. They're realistic, valuable, and can ship in 2 weeks on your current stack.
