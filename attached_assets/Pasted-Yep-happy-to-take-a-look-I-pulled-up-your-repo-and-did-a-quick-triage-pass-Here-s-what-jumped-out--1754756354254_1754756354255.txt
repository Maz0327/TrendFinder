Yep—happy to take a look. I pulled up your repo and did a quick triage pass. Here’s what jumped out right away (highest-priority first):

1. Sensitive/session artifacts are committed
   Files like `cookies.txt`, `headers.txt`, `session.jar`, `test_session.jar`, etc. are in the repo. Those can leak auth and get you banned by APIs. Purge them from history and rotate any keys/sessions they relate to. ([GitHub][1])

2. Massive junk checked in (will slow everything and cause odd bugs)
   `node_modules/`, `.cache/`, `.local/ state/ replit/ agent`, `.upm/`, a bunch of `*.zip` and `*.jar` blobs are all tracked. These belong in `.gitignore` (or LFS if you truly need binaries). Also, `node_modules` should never be committed. ([GitHub][1])

3. README clone path is wrong
   Your README says to clone `strategic-content-analysis-platform.git`, but this repo is `Strategist-App`. That’ll confuse contributors and scripts. Update the instructions. ([GitHub][1])

4. Mixed stacks at the root
   You’ve got Node/TS (Vite/Express/Drizzle) alongside Python files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) at top level. Split Python into its own `/python` folder (with its own venv and `.gitignore`) or a separate repo to avoid tooling collisions. ([GitHub][1])

5. Build artifacts and one-off exports in root
   Multiple Chrome extension zips and tarballs are versioned. Ship these via Releases or ignore them; don’t keep generated bundles in `main`. ([GitHub][1])

6. Env hygiene
   `.env.example` exists (great). Expand it to include every integration your README claims (OpenAI, Reddit, YouTube, Google Trends, News APIs, DB URL, session secret, etc.) so new envs don’t silently half-work. ([GitHub][1])

Quick fixes you can apply now

* Add/replace `.gitignore` with at least:

  ```
  node_modules/
  .cache/
  .local/
  .upm/
  attached_assets/
  chrome-extension-*.zip
  *.jar
  *.tar.gz
  *.log
  cookies.txt
  headers.txt
  .env
  ```

* Remove tracked junk and secrets, then commit:

  ```
  git rm -r --cached node_modules .cache .local .upm attached_assets *.zip *.jar *.tar.gz cookies.txt headers.txt
  git commit -m "chore: untrack build artifacts, secrets, and caches"
  ```

* (Strongly recommended) Purge secrets from history:

  * If you can install it: `git filter-repo --path cookies.txt --path headers.txt --invert-paths`
  * Or use BFG Repo-Cleaner.
    Then force-push and rotate any tokens/sessions that ever lived in the repo.

* Fix README clone instructions and any port/URL mismatches (README currently mentions running at `http://localhost:5000`; confirm that matches your server config). ([GitHub][1])

About your Bright Data timeouts (based on the issues you’ve described before): common causes & quick hardening

* Set explicit timeouts and retries with backoff on your HTTP client.
* Use keep-alive agents (Node’s `http.Agent({ keepAlive: true })`) to reduce socket churn.
* Add per-request and overall job time budgets; move long crawls to a queue/worker (BullMQ/Redis).
* Log every outbound call’s URL, status, duration, and error so you can spot rate-limit patterns.
* Validate proxies/creds at boot and fail fast if they’re missing.

Limits of this pass
GitHub’s UI wouldn’t let me open individual files in this session (I could see the root listing and README snippet but not drill into `server/` or `client/` code). If you want a line-by-line code audit (routes, schema, Bright Data calls, OpenAI usage, error handling, etc.), zip just `/server` and `/client` (or grant a read-only mirror) and I’ll do a deeper review with concrete diffs and fixes. ([GitHub][1])

Want me to generate a cleaned `.gitignore` and a one-shot script to sanitize the repo history for you?
