# Glasp Web Scraping Experiment - July 15, 2025

## Pre-Implementation Status

### Legal Assessment ✅
- **Robots.txt Review**: Glasp allows scraping of public content, only blocks private areas (/settings, /home, /secret-signup, /explore, /subscribe, /unsubscribe, /uploaded, /pdfs)
- **Terms of Service**: No explicit web scraping restrictions found
- **Target Content**: Public highlight pages, user profiles, popular content
- **Compliance**: Respectful scraping with proper delays and headers

### Technical Approach ✅
- **Isolated Implementation**: Separate scraping service, won't affect main system
- **Phase 1**: Test with 10-20 highlights to verify concept
- **Phase 2**: Integration with existing trends system if successful
- **Rollback Plan**: Easy removal with feature flag, current fallback preserved

### Current Glasp Status
- **Service**: `server/services/glasp.ts` - Currently returns fallback data
- **Integration**: Part of 16+ platform ecosystem in trends system
- **Message**: "Glasp integration ready (API under development)"
- **Data Quality**: Informational content about knowledge highlights

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Safe Test Implementation (1-2 hours)
1. **Create test scraping function** in existing GlaspService
2. **Target public pages**: 
   - /popular - trending highlights
   - /discover - public discovery feed
   - Public user profiles
3. **Extract data points**:
   - Highlight text and context
   - Source article information
   - User engagement metrics
   - Publication timestamps
4. **Test with small dataset**: 10-20 highlights maximum
5. **Implement respectful scraping**:
   - 2-3 second delays between requests
   - Proper User-Agent headers
   - Error handling and timeouts

### Phase 2: System Integration (if Phase 1 successful)
1. **Add to trends pipeline** alongside other 15+ APIs
2. **Implement caching system** to reduce external requests
3. **Add comprehensive error handling** with graceful fallback
4. **Create feature flag** for instant disable capability
5. **Monitor performance impact** on overall system

### Risk Management
- **No system disruption**: Isolated code structure
- **Easy rollback**: Feature flag allows instant disable
- **Fallback preserved**: Current informational data remains
- **User preference alignment**: Experimental approach matches "build better, not build more"

## Success Criteria
- **Technical**: Successfully extract 10+ meaningful highlights
- **Performance**: No impact on main system response times
- **Data Quality**: Highlights relevant to strategic intelligence
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing trends interface

## Rollback Triggers
- **Performance impact**: Response times >5ms increase
- **System complexity**: Integration causes bugs in other components
- **Legal issues**: Any Terms of Service violations discovered
- **User preference**: If complexity doesn't align with system stability goals

## Next Steps
1. **Git commit**: Current stable state before experimentation
2. **Phase 1 implementation**: Create test scraping function
3. **Data validation**: Verify extracted highlights are meaningful
4. **Integration decision**: Proceed to Phase 2 or rollback based on results

**Note**: This experiment aligns with user's experimental approach while maintaining system stability as the top priority. Easy rollback capability ensures no risk to production system.
