Love what you’ve built. I dug through the archive (extension + server + services + schema) and here’s the quick read:

* You’ve got a solid **capture → analyze → brief** pipeline already:
  Chrome extension (`background-enhanced.js`, `content-enhanced.js`) grabs page/selection, screenshots, metadata, tags → server (`routes.ts`) writes to DB (see `captures`, `content_radar`, `briefs` in `supabase-schema.ts`) → AI analysis (`enhancedAIAnalyzer.ts`, `openai-analysis.ts`, `strategicIntelligenceService.ts`) → export to Sheets (`google-sheets-service.ts`) → optional YouTube/Whisper transcription (python scripts).
* This maps well to a Vayner/Sasha style PAC & reverse-pyramid workflow. You’ve basically got the **intake + thinking** layer nailed.

Where it’s light (and where strategists feel pain) is **prioritization, client context, handoff to production, sprint cadence, and “turn analysis into output fast.”** Below are concrete upgrades that would make this indispensable for a solo operator (you) and, later, a strategist pod.

# What’s great (keep leaning into this)

* **Fast capture anywhere**: the extension captures selections, images, page context. Good tags, screenshots, and source URLs.
* **AI analysis services**: you already have “truth/risk” checks (`truthAnalysisFramework.ts`) and “strategic intelligence.” This aligns with “don’t be wrong in public.”
* **Brief objects**: your `briefs` + `brief_captures` join table is perfect to assemble a PAC drop or content brief from multiple captures.
* **Transcription**: local Whisper + YouTube transcript fetchers = cheap, safe pillar intake. Great for “Document, Don’t Create.”
* **Sheets export**: a lifesaver for clients who live in Google Workspace.

# What to add (so it feels like Vayner’s internal tool)

## 1) Client context & Guardrails (so briefs are *for someone*, not generic)

**Problem:** Captures are scored in a vacuum. Strategists need “brand fit” fast.

**Add:**

* **Client Profiles** (new table): ICP, brand voice sliders, taboo topics, offers, ideal outcomes, priority platforms, approval rules.
* **Brand-Fit Score** in `content_radar`: cosine similarity between capture text and client “territory” keywords.
* **Risk Flags** (legal/IP/sentiment/DEI) surfaced from your truth analysis.
* **Audience Angle tagging** (e.g., “prospects,” “loyalists,” “category switchers”).

**Result:** Every capture ranks by **Attention x Brand Fit x Risk** for a specific client.

## 2) The PAC-Drop Generator (your weekly “Platforms & Culture” product)

A one-click generator that turns top captures into a client-ready doc.

**Spec:**

* Input: week + client + max items + theme.
* Output: **Google Doc + optional Google Slides** export:

  * “What’s breaking” (10–15 micro-trends), each with: summary, why it matters, **3 post prompts**, platform notes (TikTok/IG/LI), **pre-approved CTAs**, and **paid boost angle**.
  * “Right now” watchlist (low-confidence items)
  * “We should own” content series proposals
* Save a snapshot of the prompt & model version to the record (prompt versioning).

**Implementation:** Use your `briefs` table; add a `type='PAC'` and an exporter (you already have Sheets; add Slides/Docs).

## 3) Reverse-Pyramid Assistant (pillar → 30+ assets, automatically)

**Problem:** Strategists lose hours chopping video/audio.

**Add:**

* Upload or link a pillar (Zoom MP4 / YouTube).
* Auto-transcribe (you already have Whisper) → **scene/silence detection** → propose 20–40 clips with: hook lines, captions, platform-specific crops (9:16, 1:1, 16:9), on-screen text, hashtags, **A/B caption variants**, and suggested **CTAs**.
* Export an **edit list (EDL)** + **SRT** captions so an editor can drag-drop into Premiere/CapCut.
* Tag each clip with **hypothesis** (what it’s testing).

**Result:** This is your “one pillar = 30 micro” engine, baked in.

## 4) Attention & Action scoring (prioritization that isn’t vanity)

Add two composite scores to `content_radar`:

* **Attention Score** (0–100): time-in-view proxies (when available), saves/shares per view, comment depth (LLM-scored quality), creator account momentum, novelty vs corpus.
* **Action Likelihood** (0–100): how often similar content led to site visits/lead captures in your past (start simple: heuristic + later train).

Use these to sort PAC candidates and feed paid decisions.

## 5) Organic-to-Paid “Boost Planner”

When a capture/clip crosses an Attention threshold:

* Create a **Boost Plan**: platform, objective, audience seed, lookalike, starting budget bands (\$100/\$250/\$500), **creative variant(s)**, and a **48-hour SLA**.
* Export to **Sheets CSV** (now) and later to **Meta/LinkedIn API** for direct push.
* After flight, ingest performance and label the creative **Winner/Loser** back onto the clip record.

## 6) Two-week Sprint Mode (so you can run the Vayner cadence, solo)

Add a **Sprint board** (Week A: Explore/Test, Week B: Produce/Scale):

* Pre-built swimlanes: Capture → PAC → Brief → Draft → Approve → Publish → Boost → Report.
* SLA timers (e.g., “Trend to draft: 12h,” “Winning post to boost: 24h”).
* Auto-generate a **Weekly Results Brief**: winners, learning, next bets, budget deltas.

## 7) Production handoff & approvals

* **Creative Work Orders**: from a Brief, one click to create tasks for designer/editor with specs (safe areas, durations, copy length, brand voice).
* **Approval modes** per client: “Greenlight” tiers (pre-approved tracks), “Fast Path” (24h), “Strict” (multi-step).
* Annotate assets inline; keep a **decision log** (kind candor receipts).

## 8) Competitive dashboards (share of voice & angle mining)

* Track competitor handles; compute posting cadence, format mix, “angles” that pop, **SOV trend**.
* Feed the PAC generator with “angle gaps we can steal.”

## 9) Search & recall that actually helps

* Add **vector search (pgvector)** over captures/transcripts to find similar angles instantly (“find me all ‘price vs value’ clips that performed”).
* **Quote Bank**: extract punchy quotes with speaker/context for thumbnails and hooks.

## 10) Ingest everywhere (so you don’t break flow)

* **Slack bot / email-in**: DM a link or forward an email → becomes a capture with context.
* **Mobile share sheet** (next): iOS/Android share → capture.
* **Twitter/X & TikTok oEmbed**: pull creator metadata reliably.

## 11) Governance & safety

* Token storage for the extension in Chrome storage (not localStorage); **offline queue** if the server’s down.
* Data retention & **redaction tools** (blur names, remove PII) before client shares.
* License guardrails (music/stock) & IP risk flags (you already have the scaffolding with truth analysis).

## 12) Packaging & margins inside the tool

* A small **SOW builder**: pick package (Starter/Growth/Pro), platforms, SLA tier, expected volume → it outputs **price**, target **gross margin**, and **capacity impact** (so you don’t over-promise).
* Roll it up to a **revenue per month** forecast. (Matches your 35–50% margin targets.)

If you want, I can spec the first two deliverables (PAC Drop Generator & Reverse-Pyramid Assistant) with fields, acceptance criteria, and DB changes so you (or a contractor) can build them straight away.
