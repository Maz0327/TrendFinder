# Solution Options for Corrupted Environment

## The Problem
Your package.json has deep corruption with invalid dependency versions that don't exist (like `esbuild@^0.24.4`). This corruption survived the remix.

## Your Code is Safe
All your actual work is preserved:
- ✅ Truth Lab backend routes and database tables
- ✅ Authentication and security systems
- ✅ Chrome extension integration
- ✅ Multi-file upload functionality
- ✅ All custom features and logic

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fresh Replit Template (Recommended)
1. Create new Replit project with React/Express template
2. Copy all working code files over manually
3. Run database migration to recreate tables
4. Result: Clean environment + all your features

### Option 2: Manual Package.json Recreation
1. Delete current package.json completely
2. Initialize fresh npm project
3. Install only essential packages one by one
4. Gradually add back features

### Option 3: Direct Code Export
I can create a complete code export with:
- All source files
- Database migration scripts
- Setup instructions
- You import into fresh project

## Time Investment
- Option 1: ~30 minutes to get fully working
- Option 2: ~60 minutes, higher risk
- Option 3: ~15 minutes for export, ~45 minutes for setup

## Recommendation
**Option 1 (Fresh Template)** is cleanest - you'll have a working environment immediately, and we preserve all your months of development work.
