# Content Radar Application

## Overview
This project is a Strategic Intelligence platform designed to transform raw content signals into strategic decisions. It leverages a DSD Signal Drop methodology, a Truth Analysis Framework, and a Collective Intelligence Network. The platform combines manual content curation with AI-powered analysis (GPT-5 selective reasoning) to identify cultural moments, predict viral trends, and generate strategic briefs. Integrated with Supabase for authentication, real-time features, storage, and edge computing, its core purpose is to provide a comprehensive solution for strategic intelligence, enabling users to make informed strategic decisions based on data-driven insights.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (August 20, 2025)
- **Complete Security Hardening Implementation**: Deployed production-grade security infrastructure with strict environment validation, comprehensive CORS protection, multi-tier rate limiting, and enhanced authentication middleware
- **Authentication Security**: Implemented strict Bearer token validation via Supabase JWT with no development bypasses in production mode, ensuring all API routes are protected by default
- **CORS Protection**: Created environment-based origin validation system with Chrome extension support, API-only CORS application (static assets unaffected), and wildcard subdomain support
- **Rate Limiting**: Deployed multi-tier rate limiting (300/min public, 1000/min auth, 50/min heavy operations) with per-route granular control and memory-based store
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Activated comprehensive request/response timing, error tracking with stack traces, performance monitoring, and security event logging with request ID tracking
- **Legacy Authentication Cleanup**: Consolidated all authentication to single unified supabase-auth middleware system, migrated all server imports from legacy middleware/auth paths, removed duplicate authentication code, and updated mock flag system from VITE_UIV2_MOCK to MOCK_AUTH/VITE_MOCK_AUTH for cleaner development/production separation
- **Project Scoping Implementation**: Deployed comprehensive user vs project data separation with X-Project-ID header support in API client, automatic project context injection in all hooks (useCaptures, useMoments, useBriefs, useFeeds), server-side project-scope middleware for transparent header/query parameter handling, and daily briefing route for user-level cross-project analytics
- **Multi-File Upload System (Part 5)**: Implemented comprehensive file upload infrastructure with database schema migration for file metadata (file_path, file_type, file_size, content_hash, notes), server-side multer integration with Supabase Storage, client-side batch upload with UploadPanel component supporting drag & drop, individual file metadata editing, progress tracking, and secure authenticated uploads with file type validation and organized storage structure
- **Production Readiness**: All security measures verified working - authentication blocking unauthorized requests (401s), CORS blocking unauthorized origins, static assets serving properly, comprehensive logging active, zero legacy authentication code paths remaining, complete project scoping infrastructure for multi-tenant data isolation, and production-grade file upload system with metadata support

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript (Vite)
