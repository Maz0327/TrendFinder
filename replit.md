# Content Radar Application

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Strategic Intelligence platform featuring the DSD Signal Drop methodology (Define→Shift→Deliver), advanced Truth Analysis Framework, and Collective Intelligence Network. The system combines manual content curation with AI-powered analysis using GPT-5 selective reasoning to identify cultural moments, predict viral trends, and generate strategic briefs. Now fully integrated with Supabase for authentication, real-time features, storage, and edge computing - transforming raw content signals into strategic decisions with enterprise-grade infrastructure.
