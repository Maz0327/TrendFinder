# Content Radar Application

## Overview
This project is a Strategic Intelligence platform that transforms raw content signals into strategic decisions. It uses the DSD Signal Drop methodology (Define→Shift→Deliver), a Truth Analysis Framework, and a Collective Intelligence Network. The platform combines manual content curation with AI-powered analysis (GPT-5 selective reasoning) to identify cultural moments, predict viral trends, and generate strategic briefs. Integrated with Supabase for authentication, real-time features, storage, and edge computing, its core purpose is to provide a comprehensive solution for strategic intelligence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript (Vite)
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn/ui (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS for styling with CSS variables)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT, social logins, magic links)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime (live updates, presence)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (media uploads, automatic thumbnails)
- **Design Philosophy**: Business-focused workflow with a unified "Explore Signals" interface and a "Today's Briefing" dashboard. Apple-inspired design system with glass effects, pill buttons, smooth animations, and SF Pro typography.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript, ES modules)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT middleware, Row Level Security)
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions (AI processing: content analysis, truth analysis, brief generation)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime channels
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage buckets
- **Session Management**: Hybrid (Supabase JWT with PostgreSQL session fallback)
- **API Design**: Auto-generated Supabase APIs with RESTful fallback
- **Security**: Row Level Security policies for multi-tenant data isolation
- **Core Logic**: 11-table schema supporting Strategic Intelligence, and a "Truth Analysis Engine" with GPT-5 reasoning across four layers (Fact → Observation → Insight → Human Truth).

### Key Components
- **DSD Signal Drop System**: Strategic brief builder using Define→Shift→Deliver methodology.
- **Brief Canvas**: Implementation supporting 8 block types (text, image, capture_ref, note, quote, shape, list, chart) with autosave, snapshots, and collaborative locking.
- **Truth Analysis Framework**: 4-layer philosophical analysis (Fact→Observation→Insight→Human Truth) using GPT-5.
- **Strategic Intelligence Features**: Viral potential scoring, cultural moment detection, brand voice alignment scoring, hypothesis tracking.
- **Collective Intelligence Network**: Anonymized pattern recognition, cultural moment emergence detection, network confidence scoring.
- **Chrome Extension**: Full-featured browser extension with token-based authentication, interactive element capture, platform detection, and seamless integration with the analysis pipeline.
- **Export Capabilities**: Google Slides, CSV/Markdown, Quote Bank, Manual Boost Planner.
